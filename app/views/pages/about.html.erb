      <p>Soon to finish a web development bootcamp with Le Wagon, I am skilled in HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, SQL, Ruby, and Rails.

      I am a creative and driven individual with a BA Fashion Design degree from the University of Westminster. With 6 years previous experience in the fashion industry as a menswear designer, I pride myself on my eye for detail and design. I am skilled in Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator and InDesign, research, illustration, and multi product fashion design.

      I am excited to combine my new skills with my previous experience and begin a new career in tech.
